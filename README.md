# Sprint 7 Project

	In this project, the students are required to run tests on four API endpoints using the command line. This involves using GitHub repositories, writing javascipt code,
and finally successfully running the tests through the command line. Through this project, the students are able to apply the lessons and use the skills they have acquired
not only on the current chapter, but from the previous ones as well. 


DOCUMENTATION SOURCE: apiDoc (server URL/docs/)

Technologies and Techniques used:

1. Postman - used in the project to Send API request to have a better idea of how the system works. 
2. Github - was linked to the student's tripleten account so the project can be submitted and reviewed and also for the student to have access to the project repository template. 
3. GitBash - was used to clone the repository to the local computer so student can work on it remotely. 
4. Visual Studio Code - was used to edit/create .js test files. 
5. Windows Terminal - was used to run test commands. 


How to run the tests:

Make sure prerequisites are completed such as npm installation, repository is cloned locally, and server on the file config.js is updated. 

1. Edit provided test templates for them to follow the requirements and run the proper tests. 
2. On your terminal, switch to your project directory. 
3. To run all tests at once simply type in the command "npx jest tests" which will run all available tests on the "tests" directory. 
4. To run specific tests, the command "npx jest test/{testName} can be used. In this case they are: getHandlers.test.js, postHandlers.test.js, put.Handlers.test.js, and delete.handlers.test.js.
